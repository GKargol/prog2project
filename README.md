## Development Notes

- To start testing, use `node server.js` to open a local port via express. "Go Live" plugin will not work due to listing on a different port.

### Todo List
- Create seperate HTML pages for different sections in performance report. Or, find a way to have pages feature in one HTML file. 
- Format all the pages to still look good
- Add date/email formatting to relevant text boxes'
- Create collections for each section for easier submitting and saving of data. All helps with recall.
